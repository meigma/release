# Configure OCI image publication

Use this guide to add signed, multi-architecture GHCR images to a repository that already uses the Meigma Go release workflows. The [OCI image contract](../reference/oci-image-contract.md) defines the reusable workflow interfaces, image contents, tags, signatures, attestations, and recovery behavior.

The documented workflow revision is `052e8277da00bf6369093ed8736cf5d21195d843`.

## Prerequisites

Before changing the consumer repository, confirm that:

- [Configure GitHub Releases](configure-github-releases.md) is complete;
- the Go command builds as a static Linux binary for both `amd64` and `arm64`;
- GitHub Actions policy permits the pinned Meigma workflows and actions;
- the repository's workflow token policy permits `packages: write`;
- GitHub Packages is enabled for the organization;
- `mise`, Git, GitHub CLI, ORAS, Cosign, and Docker are available for local verification; and
- GitHub CLI is authenticated with package read access.

Record the consumer repository and immutable workflow revision:

```bash
export REPOSITORY="$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)"
export RELEASE_REVISION=052e8277da00bf6369093ed8736cf5d21195d843
export IMAGE="ghcr.io/${REPOSITORY,,}"
```

The publisher does not accept a custom image name. A repository named `OWNER/REPOSITORY` publishes `ghcr.io/owner/repository`.

## 1. Copy the image configuration

From a checkout of `meigma/release`, copy the example configuration into the consumer repository. Stop and merge by hand if either destination already exists.

```bash
export CONSUMER=/absolute/path/to/consumer
test ! -e "$CONSUMER/melange.yaml"
test ! -e "$CONSUMER/apko.yaml"
cp examples/go-release/melange.yaml "$CONSUMER/"
cp examples/go-release/apko.yaml "$CONSUMER/"
```

The shared workflow uses Melange to package the canonical GoReleaser Linux binaries as signed APKs. apko composes those packages into one OCI index for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`. It does not compile the command again.

Ensure the consumer's `mise.toml` and `mise.lock` contain the Melange and apko versions required by the target workflow revision. The current example uses Melange `0.59.1` and apko `1.2.37`.

## 2. Set project values

Edit `melange.yaml`:

- replace package name `example` with the command's binary name;
- replace the description;
- replace `LicenseRef-Proprietary` with the repository's SPDX license expression; and
- replace `/usr/bin/example` with the intended image command path.

Keep these contract values:

- `version: ${{vars.version}}`;
- target architectures `x86_64` and `aarch64`;
- the Wolfi repository and keyring;
- installation mode `0755`; and
- installation ownership `0:0`.

Edit `apko.yaml`:

- replace package name `example` with the Melange package name;
- replace `/usr/bin/example` with the installed command path;
- replace the title and description annotations;
- replace `https://github.com/OWNER/REPOSITORY` with the consumer repository URL; and
- replace `LicenseRef-Proprietary` with the repository's SPDX license expression.

Keep these contract values:

- the `nonroot` user and group at ID `65532`;
- `run-as: nonroot`;
- architectures `amd64` and `arm64`;
- the CA certificate package and `SSL_CERT_FILE`; and
- `/usr/bin` in `PATH`.

Do not add a compiler or source build to either configuration. The authoritative executable comes from GoReleaser through the verified `oci-input` artifact.

## 3. Add the builder and publisher jobs

Use the complete caller in `examples/go-release/.github/workflows/release.yml` as the source. The image path consists of two jobs:

1. `oci-image` calls `go-oci-build.yml` with the canonical Linux artifact ID and digest from `release-assets`.
2. `oci-publish` calls `publish-oci-image.yml` with the authoritative OCI artifact ID, artifact digest, and image index digest from `oci-image`.

The publisher job must grant only these permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  actions: read
  artifact-metadata: write
  attestations: write
  contents: read
  id-token: write
  packages: write
```

Pin every reusable workflow to the same full revision:

```text
052e8277da00bf6369093ed8736cf5d21195d843
```

Make `github-release` depend on `oci-publish`. That ordering keeps the GitHub Release in draft state when registry publication, signing, or attestation fails.

## 4. Rehearse without registry writes

Keep both publication controls disabled for the first tag rehearsal:

```yaml
publish-image: false
publish-release: false
```

The run still builds the APK repository and OCI index, verifies the canonical binaries and image metadata, and validates the publisher's artifact handoff. It does not log in to GHCR, create tags, sign an image, create OCI attestations, or publish the GitHub Release.

Inspect the `oci-image` workflow artifact. It must contain:

```text
apko.lock.json
apk-signing.rsa.pub
configuration/apko.yaml
configuration/melange.yaml
image-digest.txt
layout/index.json
layout/oci-layout
layout/blobs/sha256/*
packages/aarch64/*
packages/x86_64/*
sboms/sbom-aarch64.spdx.json
sboms/sbom-x86_64.spdx.json
```

Follow [Rehearse and recover GitHub Releases](rehearse-and-recover-github-releases.md) for the tag and draft procedure.

## 5. Publish the image

After the rehearsal passes, change both controls in the same reviewed commit:

```yaml
publish-image: true
publish-release: true
```

Create the next stable `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` release through Release Please. The image publisher rejects non-stable tags.

A successful `v1.2.3` run always publishes the immutable exact tag:

```text
1.2.3
```

It also advances `1.2`, `1`, and `latest` when `1.2.3` is newer than each channel's current stable version. An out-of-order or backport release publishes its exact tag and advances only the channels for which it is newer; it never moves a channel backward.

The publisher enforces exact-tag immutability before uploading registry content. If `1.2.3` already resolves to a different digest, publication fails without writing the candidate image. Consumers that require repeatable deployment must use `ghcr.io/owner/repository@sha256:...`, not a moving tag.

Package visibility follows the organization's package-creation setting; it does not inherit repository visibility. After the first complete publication, inspect the package:

```bash
gh api "orgs/${REPOSITORY%%/*}/packages/container/${REPOSITORY#*/}" --jq .visibility
```

The required delivery state is `public`. If the result is `private`, an organization owner must inspect the signed and attested image, then use the package settings page to change its visibility to **Public**. GitHub does not expose a supported Packages REST operation for this visibility change. Until it is public, anonymous pulls fail.

## 6. Verify the published image

Set the release tag and authenticate ORAS. Authentication is required while the package remains private.

```bash
export TAG=v1.2.3
gh auth token | oras login ghcr.io --username "$(gh api user --jq .login)" --password-stdin
export DIGEST="$(oras resolve "$IMAGE:${TAG#v}")"
test "$DIGEST" = "$(oras resolve "$IMAGE:latest")"
printf 'Image: %s@%s\n' "$IMAGE" "$DIGEST"
```

Verify the keyless Cosign signature against the reusable publisher identity:

```bash
cosign verify \
  --certificate-identity "https://github.com/meigma/release/.github/workflows/publish-oci-image.yml@$RELEASE_REVISION" \
  --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
  "$IMAGE@$DIGEST"
```

Verify the GitHub provenance attestation from both GitHub and the registry:

```bash
gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE@$DIGEST" \
  --repo "$REPOSITORY" \
  --signer-workflow meigma/release/.github/workflows/publish-oci-image.yml \
  --signer-digest "$RELEASE_REVISION" \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" \
  --deny-self-hosted-runners

gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE@$DIGEST" \
  --repo "$REPOSITORY" \
  --bundle-from-oci \
  --signer-workflow meigma/release/.github/workflows/publish-oci-image.yml \
  --signer-digest "$RELEASE_REVISION" \
  --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" \
  --deny-self-hosted-runners
```

Verify each platform signature and SBOM attestation:

```bash
for ARCH in amd64 arm64; do
  PLATFORM_DIGEST="$(
    oras manifest fetch "$IMAGE@$DIGEST" |
      jq -r --arg arch "$ARCH" \
        '.manifests[] | select(.platform.os == "linux" and .platform.architecture == $arch) | .digest'
  )"
  cosign verify \
    --certificate-identity "https://github.com/meigma/release/.github/workflows/publish-oci-image.yml@$RELEASE_REVISION" \
    --certificate-oidc-issuer https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com \
    "$IMAGE@$PLATFORM_DIGEST"
  gh attestation verify "oci://$IMAGE@$PLATFORM_DIGEST" \
    --repo "$REPOSITORY" \
    --bundle-from-oci \
    --predicate-type https://spdx.dev/Document/v2.3 \
    --signer-workflow meigma/release/.github/workflows/publish-oci-image.yml \
    --signer-digest "$RELEASE_REVISION" \
    --source-ref "refs/tags/$TAG" \
    --deny-self-hosted-runners
done
```

Finally, run both published platforms:

```bash
docker run --rm --platform linux/amd64 "$IMAGE@$DIGEST" --version
docker run --rm --platform linux/arm64 "$IMAGE@$DIGEST" --version
```

Both commands must report the release version and commit. Running a non-native platform requires binfmt/QEMU support.

## Recovery

A failed publisher leaves the GitHub Release draft unpublished because `github-release` depends on `oci-publish` and requires its digest-pinned image output.

When repository content is unchanged, rerun only the failed jobs:

```bash
gh run rerun "$FAILED_RUN_ID" --repo "$REPOSITORY" --failed
```

This preserves the successful builder job and reuses its authoritative OCI artifact. The publisher revalidates the artifact, digest, immutable exact tag, and eligible channel tags. A retry after a partial success may add duplicate valid signatures or attestations. Public tags are assigned only after the expected digest and both platform manifests are signed and attested.

If source, workflow configuration, or tool pins must change, follow the unpublished-tag recovery procedure in [Rehearse and recover GitHub Releases](rehearse-and-recover-github-releases.md). Never move a tag after its GitHub Release is public. Never delete and recreate a public exact-version image tag to substitute different content. Publish a corrective release instead.
